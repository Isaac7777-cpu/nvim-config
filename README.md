# Goal

I have been struggling a while of whether to make this available publicly. One thing that I think `nvim` works well on is that it is a personalized thing that gives the maximum speed on the development flow. Therefore, I always think a direct clone of a distro would not work as this is nothing more than using the `vim` keybinding in a vscode with even less support as well. However, I have come to the decision to make this publicly available for anyone who would like to have reference to set up `nvim`. Also, I have to make my own disclaimer that this repo may contain many mistakes as I am quite new to Neovim (only two months), but I think it is working up to my expectation.
